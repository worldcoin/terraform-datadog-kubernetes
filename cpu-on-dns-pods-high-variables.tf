    Getting all the DNS containers by default is hard to do.
    What we try is to make a list of datadog tags / filters that should help us find those
    We then build a filter in the following way: ($originalfilterstring) AND (item1 OR item2 OR item3...)
    If that doesn't work for your use-cause you can override the filter list or use cpu_on_dns_pods_high_filter_override
